## Clean Code:

- Code follows PEP-8
- Great work on building innovative features. In your prep features and feature engineering files comment more. It seemed like you were trying to accomplish alot 
  and had really solid ideas and code but the workflow seemed scattered. Create a markdown file in the beginning on the notebook to setup what you will be accomplishing. 
  Clearly define and label each feature so that the reader understand and more importantly you understand for whenever you review your code. 
- Good job using python functions & including docstrings and using py files. Use py files more. Try to create py files for cleaning dataset 

## Good Documentation:

- Good & informative README.md, loved the explanation of the feature engineering process. 
- Loved how you talked about why the Linear Regression model worked better. Bold metric scores to make them stand out more. 
- Use markdown cell at beginning of .ipynb explains scope and analyis
- Use Inline code comments more , and only included when helpful and necessary ( can exclude the thoughts about revisting sections)
- Could use more markdown cells throughout as section headings and explaining decisions made

## Proper Data Science:

- Nice use of masks for filtering
- Nice visualizations and analysis
- Loved how you explored using TimeSeriesSplit.


## Comments:

- Great job on project 2 :)
- Love the approach/project design using the film crew experience.
- Nice visualizations and analysis
- Be sure to have a clear process and workflow. I understand it is extremely hard to do during bootcamp. Use the time after bookcamp to make it easy to follow.
