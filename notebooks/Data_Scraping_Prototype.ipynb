This can\\'t-miss event - the first to go global - features the previously unreleased complete June 17, 1991 concert from Giants Stadium. Widely considered one of the greatest shows of the band\\'s final decade of performing, 6/17/91 also sounds unlike any Dead show you\\'ve ever heard as it was one of only two recorded on 48-track. Mixed by Jeffr ey Norman in glorious surround sound with video from the multi-camera live edit, this will be the first time the Bruce Hornsby and Vince Welnick line-up has ever appeared on the big screen . Opening with a shocking \"Eyes Of The World,\" the Dead were firing on all cylinders from the opening notes of the show, mixing beloved classics like \"Truckin\\'\" and \"Uncle John\\'s Band\" with rarities including \"Saint Of Circumstance,\" \"Might l MYAs bl,\" \"New Speedway Boogie,\" and \"China Doll.\" But the real standout was the recurrence of \"Dark Star,\" which wove in and out of the setlist, making no less than six distinct appearances and teases during the show. The Dead capped off the spectacularly night with a perfect song to send the crowd on its way - The Band\\'s \"The Weight.\"',\n",

The film pulls back the emotional layers surrounding the five days during which the community housed, fed and cared for the dislocated passengers (or the \"come from aways\" in Newfoundland parlance). While their stories were the inspiration for the extraordinary Broadway hit musical, Come From Away, the documentary, You Are Here, reveals first-hand accounts of the great kindnesses and energetic resourcefulness the community showed their unexpected guests. Their emotional and sometimes humorous story of compassion and generosity, born of a long history of rescuing and welcoming shipwrecked sailors, resonates with a legacy of healing and reconciliation for the world - especially for the survivors of those murdered on 9/11, and for the first responders who lost their own lives saving others on that fateful day.',\n",

I'll Push You is an up-close and personal look into the dynamics of a life-long friendship between of two best friends - Justin Skeesuck and Patrick Gray - as they travel across El Camino de Santiago. This feature-length documentary covers the struggle of the 34-day, 500-mile hike across mountains, deserts, hills, and valleys and features perspectives from family and friends. Even though the story begins with the challenges that come with Patrick's answering of the invitation to push Justin in a wheelchair across northern Spain, it also explores the struggles related to Justin's rare neurological disease. The parallel paths of Patrick's experience in Spain and Justin's life journey come together in a singular moment to reveal to Patrick something unezpected. The story's beautiful cinematography is set to poignant music tracks that underscore, perfectly, the inspiring example of generosity and vulnerability on display. The film is an intimate portrait of an epic journey and explores the true meaning of friendship, generosity, and vulnerability. It's a one-of-a-kind documentary chronicling their pilgrimage, which will resonate with viewers craving stories of faith, hope, love, and the power of community. Their trek in 2014 captured the imagination of the world and was featured in the Huffington Post, The Meredith Vieira Show, Der Spiegel, Fox and Friends, and many other outlets. Since their return from Spain, the subjects of the film are sharing their message of hope, faith, and community worldwide.\",\n",
